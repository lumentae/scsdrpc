A WIP Discord Rich Presence for SCS Software games (Euro Truck Simulator, American Truck Simulator) using their telemetry api.  
No releases yet, but will come soon…

## Installation
1. Download the latest release
2. Find your ETS2/ATS installation folder. It should end in `linux_x64` or `win_x64` and look like this on Windows `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Euro Truck Simulator 2\bin\win_x64`.
3. Copy the extracted file to your ETS2/ATS installation folder + `/plugins`. You might need to create the `plugins` folder.
4. Download [this](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/3.2.1/discord_game_sdk.zip) ZIP file, go to `lib/x86_64` and extract `discord_game_sdk.dll` or `discord_game_sdk.so` into your game folder from step 2.
